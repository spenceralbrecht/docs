# Getting Started

The VMPower agent is a tool you can download to provide login session history to VMPower. You can use this to:

- Skip VM schedule actions based on user logins
- Auto-off virtual machines based on user login activity

You can find the VMPower agent source code [here](https://github.com/vmpowerio/agent).

## Getting Your API Key and Secret

You'll need an API Key and API Secret to authenticate the VMPower agent.

To create a key:

- Login to the [VMPower Account Details Section](https://vmpower.io/dashboard/account-details/account) and click the **'CONFIGURE API ACCESS'** button.

- Click the **'GENERATE API SECRET'** button

Your API key never changes but you can generate a new secret at any time. For your security, we can only show the secret to you once. Store this secret and **do not** expose it publicly. When you generate an API secret, it will break any applications using your previous key.
