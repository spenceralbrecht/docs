# Azure Active Directory

If your company uses Azure Active Directory to manage your work login account, you can use your same work credentials to log into VMPower.

## Signing Up

Just go to the [signup page](https://vmpower.io/signup) and click 'Sign in with Microsoft'. VMPower will automatically read your profile and sign you into VMPower instantly.

## Existing VMPower Account

You can convert your existing VMPower account to login from your work credentials by ensuring your current VMPower account uses the same email as your work account. Sign out of VMPower, then login with the 'Sign in with Microsoft' button.

## Team Members

Invited team members can log in with their work credentials as well. VMPower generates a password for new users. However when a user gets their invite email, at any time they can log in with their work account given that their email matches their Microsoft account email.
