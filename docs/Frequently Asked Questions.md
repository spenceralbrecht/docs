# Automation Schedules

## How Do You Schedule Automations for Every Week?

VMPower Automate VM Schedules execute on a weekly basis until you tell them to stop (by disabling the schedule, deleting the schedule, deleting the associated VM Group or removing the VMs in the associated VM Group).

## Can I Select which VMs occupy a VM Slot?

Yes! You can click the 'VMPower Enabled' checkbox on the VM of choice. This will either allocate or deallocate VM slot to the VM. Once you make a VM 'VMPower Enabled' you can automate the VM as well as get resize and unused volume recommendation.

# Billing

## Can I pay via PO instead of a credit card?

Yes! However we require PO's to be made for annual subscriptions only. Please send us an email at support@vmpower.io to make arragments to pay by PO.

## Where can I get my Invoice

You can view all of your invoices from the [Invoices section](https://app.vmpower.io/dashboard/account-details/billing/invoices) within the Billing information page.
