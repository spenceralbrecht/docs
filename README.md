# VMPower Help Docs
COPY of Support and FAQ documents for VMPower users accessible at [http://docs.vmpower.com/](http://docs.vmpower.com/). This is only here for SEO purposes so that old links pointing to docs.vmpower.com instead of help.vmpower.com will work.

# Deployment
A push to any branch specified in the [.github/workflows/ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) file will trigger a Github Action that deploys the updated docs to [http://help.vmpower.com](http://help.vmpower.com).
